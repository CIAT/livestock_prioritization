Maximum HSH,"Human heat stress index, maximum value of the month","The heat index (HI) was calculated from daily data and empirical equations based on Steadman (1979a; 1979b) relating the HI to dry-bulb temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%). Using the daily values the maximum of each month is first calculated, and following that we calculate the climatological mean of each month, and then the maximum, mean and median of the year.",Human heat stress index,"The equation is as follows, HI = c1 + c2 * T + c3 * R + c4 * T * R + c5 * T^2 + c6 * R^2 + c7 * T^2 * R + c8 * T * R^2 + c9 * T^2 * R^2. T is the dry bulb temperature in ºC (taken to be the daily mean temperature). R is the relative humidity in %, and the values of the constants c1 to c9 are: c1=-8.78469475556; c2=1.61139411; c3=2.33854883889; c4=-0.14611605; c5=-0.012308094; c6=-0.0164248277778; c7=2.211732 x 10^-3; c8=7.2546 x 10^-4; c9=-3.582 x 10^-6.",HSH_max.tif
HSM_NTx35,Total number of heat stress days per month for maize,"The number of days with daily maximum temperatures above a given threshold during the growing season. To compute this, we use a maize crop calendar, and focus on the main growing season. Cropping calendars are taken from Jagermeyr et al. (2022), which is a modified version of Sacks et al. (2010). For maize, we use a temperature threshold of 35ºC, and assume that at this temperature heat stress starts affecting maize plants.",number of heat stress days for maize,"The number of days with daily maximum temperatures above 35 Celsius degrees during the growing season.

NDWL0,"Total number of waterlogging (at starting saturation, 0%) days (NDWL0) per month","Number of waterlogging days. A waterlogging day is defined to occur when the soil moisture is just above field capacity, and moving toward saturation. This index is calculated using a simple water balance model that uses daily precipitation from CHIRPS, daily temperatures from CHIRTS, and solar radiation from AgERA5. The simple watbal model also uses soil water holding capacity and rooting depth data from the ISRIC SoilGrids 1km database. The single point model is implemented here https://github.com/fabiolexcastro/Gates-smallholder-adaptation/blob/master/watbal/watbal.R. The Adaptation Atlas implementation is a spatialized version of that (see https://github.com/AdaptationAtlas/hazards/tree/main/R) optimized for the terra R package. This watbal model is a modified version (modified to calculate waterlogging) of the one used by Jones and Thornton (2009).",number of waterlogging days at 0%,"Count the number of waterlogging days.

A water stress day is defined as a day in which the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration is < 0.5 (i.e., less than 50% of water demand is met).
